    {{sectionHeading "The Foundation"}}
    <p>
        All modules in Pure build on top of <a href="https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/">Normalize.css</a>. It's our foundational layer to maintain some degree of cross-browser consistency. You can pull in Normalize.css by adding this {{code "<link>"}} element on your page:
    </p>

    {{#code wrap=true}}
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/purecss@{{pure.version}}/build/base-min.css">
    {{/code}}

    <h3>A bit about Normalize.css</h3>
    <p>
        <a href="https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/">Normalize.css</a> is an open-source project by <a href="http://twitter.com/necolas">Nicolas Gallagher</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/jon_neal">Jonathan Neal</a>. <a href="http://nicolasgallagher.com/about-normalize-css/">In their own words</a>:
    </p>

    <blockquote class="content-quote">
        Normalize.css is a small CSS file that provides better cross-browser consistency in the default styling of HTML elements. Itâ€™s a modern, HTML5-ready, alternative to the traditional CSS reset."
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Normalize.css comes with <a href="https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/wiki">great documentation</a> and a <a href="http://nicolasgallagher.com/about-normalize-css/">thorough guide</a> explaining how it differs from a traditional reset. You can also check out YUI's <a href="http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/cssnormalize/">CSSNormalize</a> module, which includes the generic Normalize along with a <a href="http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/cssnormalize/#context">contextual version</a>. The contextual version of Normalize only applies normalized styles to elements that are children of an element with the class name {{code "yui3-normalized"}}.
    </p>

    {{sectionHeading "Extras"}}
    <p>
        In addition to Normalize.css rules, Pure's Base module contains some common styles that are used by most websites.
    </p>

    <h3>Hiding Elements</h3>

    <p>
        Add the {{code "hidden"}} attribute to an HTML element to hide it from the screen via {{code "display: none !important;"}}. Alternatively, for compatibility with old IE, you may use the CSS classname {{code ".hidden"}}.
    </p>

    {{#code "html"}}
    <input type="text" name="_csrf" hidden>
    {{/code}}


    <h3>Hiding Elements in Legacy Browsers</h3>
    <p>
        If you need to toggle an HTML element's display using JavaScript, and want to fully support Internet Explorer 7 &amp; 8, we suggest creating your own {{code ".hidden"}} CSS class instead of using the {{code "hidden"}} attribute.
    </p>

    <h3>Responsive Images</h3>

    <p>
        Add the {{code ".pure-img"}} class name to an {{code "<img>"}} element to make it scale with the viewport. This is handy when building responsive websites.
    </p>

    {{#code "html"}}
    <img class="pure-img" src="...">
    {{/code}}

    {{sectionHeading "Moving beyond Normalize"}}
    <p>
        Normalize.css is a great starting place for your project, but some HTML elements such as forms, tables, and menus require more styling than what's provided by Normalize.
    </p>

    <p>
        We made a more opinionated look and feel for these elements, while keeping them minimal enough so that you can customize them for your site or app's needs. Check out our CSS for <a href="{{pathTo 'forms'}}">Forms</a>, <a href="{{pathTo 'tables'}}">Tables</a>, and <a href="{{pathTo 'menus'}}">Menus</a>.
    </p>
